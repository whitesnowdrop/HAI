### Welcome to the Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) Lab
Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea

We are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence (AI) with a primary emphasis on prioritizing people. Human-centered AI (HAI) is an emerging field dedicated to crafting AI systems that enhance and supplement human capabilities rather than replacing them. The potential impact of AI extends to every facet of our lives and civilization, spanning social bonds, ethics, the economy, healthcare, education, and government. HAI is focused on upholding human control in a manner that guarantees AI meets our requirements while operating with optimal efficiency.

Operating at the intersection of machine learning, edge computing, and human-AI interaction, our goal is to construct innovative and experimental HAI systems, considering multiple dimensions such as efficacy, social impact, privacy, and safety. Specifically, we design and implement machine learning, feedback learning (reinforcement learning), mobile, and IoT systems to facilitate always-available and highly-enriched awareness of human. Additionally, we are actively engaged in shaping a future where technology serves humanity with effectiveness through the collaborative development of healthcare and nursing AI, law AI, and education AI with domain experts.

Our lab is committed not only to nurturing cutting-edge scientists but also to fostering multidisciplinary scholars proficient in enhancing social movements, pedagogical methods, and legislative practices through the utilization of AI.
